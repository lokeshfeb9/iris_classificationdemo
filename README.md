## Description

The Iris Classification project is a machine learning application that uses logistic regression to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project serves as an educational resource and example for those interested in machine learning classification tasks.

## Features

- Classification of Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- Utilizes logistic regression algorithm.
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python for coding and scripting.
- Scikit-Learn library for machine learning algorithms.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and visualization.

## Demo

You can explore the Jupyter Notebook containing the Iris classification project and its code in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification).

## Installation
